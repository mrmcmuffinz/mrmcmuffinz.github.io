I am a highly driven and detail-oriented technologist with a deep passion for DevOps, cloud-native infrastructure, and self-hosted environments. I enjoy working with tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Istio, and GPU computing, and I'm always looking to expand my technical expertise.

I approach challenges methodically, breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps and creating documentation and templates that ensure reproducibility. At IBM, I led major infrastructure migrations and improved CI/CD systems, demonstrating both leadership and technical acumen.

In addition to my professional focus, I am dedicated to personal growth, managing my health through a Mediterranean lifestyle. I am strategic, curious, and committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of my life.
