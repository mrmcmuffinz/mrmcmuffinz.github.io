The new year, 2026, has started and we’re already one month in, which feels like a good time for an update. Or at least an update for whoever happens to be reading this across the world. Before getting into the new year, though, it’s worth recapping what happened last year.

## Looking Back: 2025

I had several life events occur, but primarily I dealt with my father having a stroke and my job laying me off. I don't write this in search of sympathy but more to help express myself in writing. It has been hard mentally and emotionally, and that's the primary reason why I spent the remainder of last year on myself. 

In an effort to keep cool, calm, and collected, I did a bunch of stuff I'd put off for a very long time. Most notably:

1. Cleaned my garage!
2. Fixed my mountain bike as it had bad hardware and wheels.
3. Fixed both my riding and push mower and cut my grass. The riding mower had bad spindles and the push mower I hadn't used in 3 years!
4. Actually played some video games and completed three: Doom Eternal, Dungeon of the Endless and Onimusha: Warlords.
5. Managed to drop some weight, about 10 pounds.

## The Plan: 2026 Goals

After spending some time on myself, I also managed to focus on what I wanted to do for 2026. I went ahead and wrote down some thoughts in my notebook for my goals, and then I had the bright idea to create a Jira scrum board to track everything! Here's my plan for this year and what I think will help me land a new employment opportunity.

**1. Upskill myself through certifications**

Hear me out—I know many people see this as a negative and possibly even think that people who get them just exam dump questions and memorize. In my case, that isn't my focus. I've actually been taking Udemy courses to learn and practice what I want to do, and in the absence of a job, I need to do something. The certificates I'm interested in are:
- AWS Cloud Practitioner
- AWS AI Practitioner
- Certified Kubernetes Application Developer
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- Certified Argo Project Associate
- Terraform Associate

**2. Revisit my passion for coding**

Once I can complete some of the prior certs, I'll be revisiting my passion for coding. I've coded in Python for most of my career and it's something I want to continue to do, but I also want to expand into other languages like Node.js and Golang.

**3. Infrastructure as code**

One thing is programming languages and another is infrastructure as code. Technologies such as Ansible and Terraform are also on my mind. In fact, I have the Terraform Associate cert on my list of todos, so I won't be shying away from the DevOps world.

**4. Dive into artificial intelligence**

Coding is one thing, but I also want to dive into the artificial intelligence realm—not because of the current fads or trends, but because I'm curious and I think there's something I can gain by expanding my toolset. Even with the looming fear of my career disappearing due in part to AI/ML, I still want to learn and adapt.

**5. Explore systems design**

I want to really dive into systems design and explore what could have been. Let me explain: I worked at IBM for many years and learned a lot. However, because I worked at IBM, I think I may have limited what I could have been exposed to. I say this because I predominantly worked in the data warehousing and cloud divisions but never really experienced the world outside of IBM. And if we look at Gartner's Magic Quadrant, IBM hasn't really been up there with the big players and has mostly been in a niche area. Don't get me wrong—they paid well—but I got comfortable, and now I'm diving into a new and unexplored area for me!

## How I'm Tracking Progress

All of what I mentioned above I tried to document in Jira epics and decomposed them into smaller tasks. Though I must admit I didn't do this on my own, I actually found out that Claude AI has a connector for Jira and did the work to configure it. Once configured, I spent a few days basically prompting with Claude to come up with my plan and document it via Jira tickets.

Yes, I had issues. Yes, it hallucinated a bit. Yes, it also went overboard on descriptions. However, the way I see it, it was a learning experience and a way for me to help offload some of that burden to an external entity. I also had to review what it wrote and even discussed some of the ideas I had with friends. All this to say: I didn't just take it at face value or accept it at 100% correctness. It was a way for me to start something, and I think it was a good first pass. I have some ideas for future integrations, but those will wait for now.

## Current Status

Fast forward to today: I've been studying for my first certification and scheduled my first exam for February 7th, 2026. I feel confident and happy with my progress so far in studying and hope to pass the exam. Once done with this first one, I'll dive into my next one on the list above and continue to commit to my plan. 

As for job searches, I've honestly put them on pause because I want to be a prepared candidate and not waste an interviewer's time. I'll continue to post more frequently as time goes by, as there are other thoughts I have that I want to write down. 

Friends, family, and even acquaintances who may be reading this: I'm fine and have an optimistic outlook for 2026. I hope you're doing well, and feel free to reach out.
